</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I just spent the weekend at the Berkeley Reinforcement Learning Bootcamp. 
Overall I found it to be an intense but rewarding experience but also
expensive if you're paying out of pocket.
Read on for more of my thoughts and my recommendations if you should
attend.</p>
<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<p>I'm guessing most people will care about this so I'll just put it at the top.
My recommendation is basically split into three categories.</p>
<h2>I'm at least lightly interested in AI/RL and my employer will pay</h2>
<p>Then you should definitely come. It's definitely worth the weekend because
no matter what you'll be walking out of here with more knowledge than when
you started.  The information has been condensed by the experts to maximize
your learning in a short time.</p>
<h2>I'm interested but I'm paying myself</h2>
<p>Sort of a toss up here. The bootcamp is pretty expensive but it still might
be worthwhile. Read on for more details to see if it's worth it for you.</p>
<h1>An approximate schedule and what was covered</h1>
<p>The bootcamp was split over two days, with approximately 12 hours of activity
each day. In a day specifically there about</p>
<ul>
<li>2 hours of social/networking time, which included things like lunch and coffee breaks</li>
<li>3 hours of working on provided labs with PhD students available to help</li>
<li>7 hours of lectures with topics ranging from basics to cutting edge research</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lecture topics</h2>
<p>Specifically the lectures covered topics starting from V and Q learning,
through DQN, and then branched to focus on specific RL focus areas such
as various types of Model Based Learning, Model Free Learning, Evolutionary
methods, as well as lectures focused on general tips for learning how to learn
Reinforcement Learning (say that three times fast). Overall the lectures
were wellrstructured, given by a variety of speakers, and very informative.
However, the target audience skillset varied greatly, the difficultly ranged  from 
basic to extremely intense (literally cutting edge) pretty fast.</p>
<h2>Labs</h2>
<p>The labs were pretty basic, just implementations of Q and V learning, and
the "Fill in the two magic lines" type of labs. The neat part where that
there was plenty of expert TAs around to help with questions. Unfortunately
the labs were not released ahead of time, so if you came with little knowledge
of the basics you would spend most of your time stuck in the shallow
end of the pool, and wouldn't really be able to really utilize the specialized help.</p>
<h2>Networking</h2>
<p>Everyone here was pretty enthusiastic to be here so overall a great crowd. The
people certainly made the bootcamp more fun.</p>
<h1>So If I'm paying myself is it worth it?</h1>
<p>Well you'll definitely learn something, but "Is it worth it?" is a different question.
If you're just starting out in RL then you really won't be able to grok
most of the knowledge unfortunately. You'd be better off reading books and following
tutorials online.  </p>
<p>However, if you have some experience and practice using RL you're in the 
sweet spot, as the advanced topics will push your knowledge, and there are lots
of friendly experts around to answer detailed questions.  </p>
<h1>A Final Note</h1>
<p>With AI and Deep RL being a hot topic there's the risk that some of these conferences
are just cashing in on the hype without providing much content.
That is <strong>not</strong> the case with this bootcamp, lecturers and TAs were very knowledgeable,
just be sure you're prepared to understand what they're teaching you!</p>
