# Manual Edits
I changed the index page from the blogroll to about me. This required custom edits in

* pelicanconf.py: I had to change the blogroll page to be `blog.html`
* About.md: I had to change the page name to be generated as `index.html`
* sidebar.html theme: I needed to alter the pages loop and add the blog manually
