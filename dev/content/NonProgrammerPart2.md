# What Programming without being a Programmer means

Programmer, or coder, is a pretty broad term these days but in one wayt
there is a simple split to describe what a Non Programmer is, that we
can define by defining the opposite term.

I would argue that the split is  

* People that get paid primarily for their skill to write code
* People that get paid primarily to do somethhing that isn't write code  

There are people at all companies at which I've been employeed which fit into category one,
they are given software programs and the expectation of their role 
is to write code of some sort that solves a business problem. I consider
these people to be programmers

I fall into the second category, my position is more dependent on domain
expertise of supply chains and manufacturing processes. My coworkers
only know very rudimentary programming, Excel sheets and
basic SQL at most. The expectation of our job is make the manufacturing 
execution more efficient. Most do it very effectively without writing
code, but there are also plenty of opportunities were programming can
be utilized to great effect.

This is what Programming without being a Programmer means. Essentially
Programming (as a technical activity) without being a Programmer (in job title).

While it seems like a subtle difference due to
organizational designs it leads to big differences. Some of the differences
are beneficial, but some are difficult to deal with. In the next posts I'll
cover what my experience has been writing programs while not actually
being a programmer.
