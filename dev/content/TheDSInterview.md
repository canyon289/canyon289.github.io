tldr at the bottom

I have an admission to make. I so far have been
unable to successfully pass a Data Science interview.
For those who 
[have been through the process](http://treycausey.com/data_science_interviews.html) 
[you might understand why](http://www.erinshellman.com/crushed-it-landing-a-data-science-job/) 
but my own thoughts are below

##Why's an interview so difficult 
In a non interview setting when I'm asked a question, I'm able to do some 
background research, find other known solutions, and weave together a solution.
This process can take an hour up to a couple of days depending on the need.

However during an interview I get short period of time to understand the
problem, think through a solution, and articulate an answer, usually while
someone is physically watching you or waiting on the phone. It's pretty nerve
wracking.

##Why the DS interview is so difficult
During my Manufacturing Engineering interviews when I'm asked a question
it's almost always about Manufacturing Engineering. I feel confident in my 
understanding and I'm able to convincingly answer questions. I know this 
because I've gotten Manufacturing Engineering jobs.

However during Data Scientist interviews, when I'm asked a question it ranges
from basic probability, to advanced statistics, to software engineering,
to database concepts, to business communication. The range of possibilities
is enormous.

As turns out that I am not able to convincingly answer all of these questions
as I've now had multiple first round
interviews but failed to make it to the final round or secure a job.
Seems that other people have this problem too

##My second admissions and why this blog
I am partly making this blog to help myself
Every question I get asked during a data science interview will go onto
this blog, where it will be discussed, solved, and then dissected into great
detail. By explaining the answer on a public blog I also hope to gain the
ability to clearly explain advanced concepts, all in preparation for the next time.

However there is an altruistic side to this blog as well. I would have
never made it this far without the knowledge others have shared. Through
this blog I hope to add yet another place that others can use to learn more
about data science in general.

##tldr
I consistently fail at data science interviews, so I'm starting this blog
with the dual purpose of forcing me practice DS interview questions,
but also to hopefully serve as a helpful resource for others.
