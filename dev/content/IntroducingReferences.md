When learning new material I find it challenging immediately recall all
the nuances of a particular term. As a learning strategy I frequently
create flashcards and reference sheets to reinforce my understanding, and 
server as external memory. And for the first time I'm publishing them
for others to use as well.

You can find them in on the blog sidebar under the *References* section.

For now it contains a Bayesian Glossary, a quick refernece for common terms
used Bayesian statistics conversation. Coming soon will be a Bayesian Inference
methods cheatsheet, and a Tensorflow cheatsheet as well. Feel free
to contact me if you have a specific request. And happy learning!
