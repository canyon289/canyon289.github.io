##This blog
This blog is centered around the Data Science interview and
various practice problems, talking points, and concepts that
will likely be present in some way.

The intent of this blog is to create a corpus of questions
and challenges that Data Scientists to be can use to practice
before their dream job interview. 

More about the motivation of this blog can be read

##About me
I'm an engineer by training and primarily focus on improving
manufacturing processes for companies making things. Throughout
my career all the positions I've held required the discovery
of how systems and processes worked and the development of models
to solidify that understanding.
