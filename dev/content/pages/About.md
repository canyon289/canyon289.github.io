My name is Ravin Kumar. I strive to be

1. Really good at math, particularly computational math
2. An effective community member and leader
3. A knowledge contributor

Groups of people coming together and building awesome things with math
has always been cool me, whether its rocket ships or computational statistics libraries.

I experience this first hand Open Source Projects as a core contributor to ArviZ and PyMC3.
I also am a scientist Google where I use data to inform decisions (although all my opinions here are my own!).
I was lucky enough do to the same at sweetgreen and SpaceX where I got to work with amazing
teams and build human and data systems.

I believe the possibility of creating great outcomes with math and data has increased faster than
the knowledge of how to do so, and I am working to fill the gap. You'll my, public,
efforts in

* My Open Source profile
* A book Bayesian Statistics
* Various presentations on topics
* An upcoming statistics course
