##About me
My name is Ravin Kumar and I'm somewhere between an engineer, programmer,
and data scientist. I currently work for SpaceX but it is important to note
that **all of the writing and opinions on this blog represent my own** and
not of any organization I work for or have worked for in the past.

# What I do as a career
My primary occupation focus has been on improving processes for companies,
typically manufacturing companies. 
I'm currently use data methods to understand organizational processes, either
making stuff doing stuff, and develop applications to to help improve those
processes. For example check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravinakumar)


In the past I've served in more traditional industrial/manufacturing
engineering roles, using techniques such as tolerance analysis and Lean/Six Sigma
methods to improve manufacturing effectiveness.

Moving forward I'm looking to increasingly learn how to leverage
data science and computational methods to understand and improve
things of all types. It really is fun!


##This blog
This blog focuses on the technologies, opinions, and challenges that are
present in my everyday life. Right now it's focused on using technology
to literally make, as in manufacture, items in a much more efficient
and effective way. 

My previous intent was to blog about Data Science interview questions and their
solutions so I could succesfully pass the interview process. But then I got a job
which made writing about the interview process much less interesting.
