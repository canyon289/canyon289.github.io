##About me
I'm somewhere between an engineer, programmer, and data scientist.
My primary occupation focus has been on improving processes for companies,
typically manufacturing companies. 
I'm currently working  at SpaceX using data methods and developing
applications to help further SpaceX's mission to Mars. 

In the past I've served in more traditional industrial/manufacturing
engineering roles, using techniques such as tolerance analysis and Lean/Six Sigma
methods to improve manufacturing effectiveness.

Moving forward I'm looking to increasingly learn how to leverage
data science and computational methods to understand and improve
things of all types. It really is fun!


##This blog
This blog focuses on the technologies, opinions, and challenges that are
present in my everyday life. Right now it's focused on using technology
to literally make, as in manufacture, items in a much more efficient
and effective way. 

My previous intent was to blog about Data Science interview questions and their
solutions so I could succesfully pass the interview process. But then I got a job
which made writing about the interview process much less interesting.
