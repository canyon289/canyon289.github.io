My name is Ravin Kumar and I'm somewhere between an engineer, programmer,
and data scientist. I currently work for SpaceX but it is important to note
not of any organization I work for or have worked for in the past.

# What I do as a career
My primary occupational focus has been on improving processes for organizations,
I currently use data methods to figure out what's going on and then develop
programs or applications to to help the organization improve.
For examples check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravinakumar)

In the past I've served in more traditional industrial/manufacturing
engineering roles, using techniques such as tolerance analysis and Lean/Six Sigma
methods to improve manufacturing effectiveness.

Moving forward I'm looking to increasingly learn how to leverage
data science and computational methods to understand and improve
things of all types. It really is fun!
