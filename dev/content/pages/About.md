My name is Ravin Kumar. I specialize in using data and statistics to
influence organizations, currently at sweetgreen and previously 
at SpaceX and other organizations. My opinions are my own and not of any 
organization.

# Open source work
I'm a big advocate of open source. Open source allows anyone access to
knowledge, not just those who can pay for expensive license fees
or college educations. Open Source is also free speech, allowing folks
to share ideas across the world. If you've been curious about open source
feel free to reach out, I'm happy to chat about it.

# My history
My primary occupational focus has been on improving processes for organizations,
I currently use data methods to figure out what's going on and then develop
programs or applications to to help the organization improve.

In the past I've served in more traditional industrial/manufacturing
engineering roles, using techniques such as tolerance analysis and Lean/Six Sigma
methods to improve manufacturing effectiveness.

Moving forward I'm looking to increasingly learn how to leverage
data science and computational methods to understand and improve
things of all types. It really is fun!
