While I wish I was smart enough to come up with everything I've found
on this blog from scratch the truth is that I've both learned a great
deal from other much smarter people share their knowledge 
and also use the their code and libraries as well.  

Instead of acknowledging them in each post I'll be keeping a running list here.
As a bonus it should also service as handy portal link if you're looking
for resources!
