If you've reached this page I'm assuming you've seen the video
[If not it's here](https://youtu.be/FH_87ZTcmQwI)

I'm really interested in applying Artificial Intelligence to manufacturing,
so much so that I started this blog over two years ago.
Everything shown shown in the video real, from my 3D printer to the CNN.
The content represents what I'm able to do, work at the intersection of
modern data methods and manufacturing.
This is also what'd I'd bring to Landing.AI along with my enthusiasm and prior experience.

If the feeling is mutual please feel free to contact me. Linkedin works well!



# The CNN Recognizer

In the video you can see that a CNN finds the correct Camera Image from a set of
a dummy images. The project in the video was not arbitrary. I actually chose it because its very practical example end to end training pipeline for manufacturing.

I wanted the CNN to be able recognize a manufactured object with a specific message
from a set of images of other objects that were similar in shape and size,
but contained different text. It would have been prohibitively dollar and
time expensive to manufacture and take pictures of thousands of training samples,
so instead I had Python computationally generate thousands of images that
approximated pictures of the real thing instead. During the image generation
some random noise as added to help generalization. The results were excellent,
the model trained on computationally generated images was very easily able to recognize the picture of the real thing.

This small scale example is directly relevant to industrial scale manufacturing.
Making physical parts is an expensive process, and top of that digitizing reality
into bits is another expensive process.
This approach was published by OpenAI, but to take credit I've seen and been
a part of similar efforts prior to the publish of this article (https://blog.openai.com/generalizing-from-simulation/)

At LandingAI these are the types of problems I want to help solve, not just the Artificial Intelligence portion,
but all the challenges to incorporate newer data capabilities into a
manufacturing business, ranging from technical implementation, to training
shop floor workers, to educating management and executives. Artificial Intelligence
can be applied to multiple areas and organization levels at the factory
and from what I've seen the opportunities are not widely being worked on!


# Behind the Scenes - 23b Hackerspace 
The video was filmed in 23b hackerspace.
A hackerspace is a community space where people can use industrial tools that are unlikely 
unlikely to be available for individual use. Through this resource folks can 
learn about manufacturing with hands on experience and through practical use.
For me in particular this space was particular helpful by providing a practical
space to apply what I had learned in an academic classroom as an undergraduate.
To this day I still use 23b to build things, ensuring that I understand
the manufacturing process not just as an engineer but also as a practitioner.
