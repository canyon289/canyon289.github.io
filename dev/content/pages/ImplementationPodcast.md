Implementation is a weekly podcast hosted by me and my fellow engineer and friend
Kiernan McGowan. In each episode  we have a no nonsense talk about the 
modern implementation of a technology. To date we've covered topics ranging
from 3D Printing to Servless Computing to Blockhain, 
diving into the fundamentals of the technology, and through its the history 
to where it'll likely be in the near future.  

We're always open to topics so if you have any suggestions please reach out!
