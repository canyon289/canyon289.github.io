Say you're the type of person that curious about how the world 
works. 
  
In most cases you would need to spend years studying the subject,
learning every nuance and detail. If you wanted to learn about Chess
you might turn to Gary Kasparov or if you were interested in Go 
Champion Lee Sedol would be a good choice.
Say you wanted to understand what made a drug safe for humans
you might need to ask entire team of experts employed company 
like Merck with over a 100 years in the business.

No doubt all of these people and organizations would 
come to mind first. After all as folks
they have demonstrated their ability to beat any
other unaided human.

But what if a second set of people can outperform these 
individuals? And what if those people could do it in as little
as a couple of months, moving from one problem to the next?

As you might have guessed the second set of people now exists.
They are adept at using modern tools and mathematics to 
to rapidly understand the key drivers
of complex systems, then create models and predictions
that outperform any other human or system for the task at hand.

As it stands humans using computers are better at Chess, Go,
and predicting which drugs are safe, better than the traditional experts in
field. And on top of that these people are given enormous flexibility
to learn from subject matter experts, answer difficult questions,
and learn an enormous amounts about pretty much any topic 
of their choosing. And they can do this over and over
for a wide range of subjects.

So there exists a job where you get to work with smart people,
learn, and employers seem to give you a lot of flexibility to do it?

##What do I need to know and how do I get this job?
Well it turns out quite a bit. I won't get into the details here
but typically you have to know a lot of math, be really good at statistics,
know a programming language or two, know a lot (seriously a lot) about how
data is captured, stored, transferred, and interpreted, and be an excellent
communicator.

And then after all trying to learn all that stuff you  have to convince
one or more people that you're worth paying to do some or all of what's mentioned
above. This is the data science interview.
