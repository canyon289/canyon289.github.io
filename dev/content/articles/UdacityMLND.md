I recently finished the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree and wanted to share
the following thoughts on my experience.

If you haven't read my [Review of Data Science Programs]({filename}./DSGuide.md)
I would do so first, to get a general explanation of the other types
of machine learning curriculum.


# The rundown
The Machine Learning Nanodegree is formatted in the previous style of Udacity
nanodegrees where you're charged $200 dollars a month until all seven projects
are completed. The projects themselves range in complexity, starting from
a basic linear regression, to clustering, to more challenging ones
such as a reinforcement learning implementation, and a CNN implementation.  

The final portion is a capstone project where you are allowed to perform
a machine learning project on any dataset of your choosing.

Overall I found the Machine Learning Nanodegree to be pretty comprehensive.
Nearly all machine learning topics were covered. Expect this Nanodegree
to take quite a bit of time, its challenging from both a code perspective
and from a mathematical understanding perspective. The knocks I have 
against the program are the level of hand holding, sometimes a bit too much
code is implemented for you, and if you're lazy you can get away with just
filling in the blanks without understanding the whole picture. However
if you're diligent and spend time understanding all the code, even the 
portions implemented for you, you'll come out with a comprehensive understanding
of how to implement Machine Learning projects.

If you're lightly interested in Machine Learning I would recommend Andrew Ng's
Coursera course over this one. But if you'd like to dive a bit deeper
and have money to spare you can't go wrong with this one as well.
