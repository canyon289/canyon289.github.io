If you are reading this you likely have reached on `{LinkedIn/Twitter/Github/Email}`
asking how to get a job at `{Google/SpaceX/Sweetgreen/Some other company}`.
This post is for you. 
Rather than give a short 280 character response,
or quick response you'll be better served by a longer answer.

## Why you shouldn't believe me (at least exclusively)
I really 
Let me talk about why you shouldn't listen to me, or just me.
### I'm only one person
Any individual is going to be biased, both in their lived experience and the way they tell it.

Aside from this post look for other people's experiences as well 
to get a distribution of perspective and form your own independent conclusion
which brings me to my second point

### Survivorship Bias

Only looking for successful cases has a name, it is called survivorship bias.

When forming a strategy be sure to consider two more categories of folks.
1. People that have applied and didn't get a job
2. People that have worked there and quit

The second group provides the most valuable feedback. For example,
I can tell you why I joined *and* left SpaceX , but I can't
tell you why I left Google because I haven't.

Be sure to balance your information sourcing accordingly.

## Why write this 
After all that it might seem pointless for me to say anything, yet again there 
are two reasons I'll do so.

### I was once like you
When I started I was also cold emailing people.
When people responded it gave me a lot of hope and
I feel now that now folks are reaching out to me I should do the same.
I found it very helpful to at least have some data rather than "no data".

### To counteract the bad advice out there
Much of the advice out there is factually false. 
So even if my perspective is biased I know what I'm saying is true
and even if its biased it's some signal. In other words

```
wrong data << missing data << biased data
```

So let's dive into it

##  "How can I get a job at XYZ company?"
Here's some possible strategies!

### Ask for blind referrals or advice
Connect with everyone at Google on Linkedin and DM them your resume.

### Resume Engineering
Stack the resume with lots of programming languages and the latest buzzwords.
The more the better.

### Getting your information from clickbait sources
Google common interview questions for company XYZ memorize them.
Here's one for SpaceX.

You start at a point, walk one mile south, one mile east, one mile north, and end up at the same
point. Where are you?

### Narrow focus
It's that "one company" or that "one perfect role" that is the one for you.
Maybe its even a couple, one of the FAANG companies, perhaps that is you
have to make it into next. If you focus on one company or one role as 
your next step you'll surely make it in.

### Blind nonstrategic persistence
At this point I'm sure you've heard about Michael Jordan taking 10,000 shots
or Steve Jobs failing, or anything else along the lines of successful people fail!

If you fail it means you need to try again right? 
How can we achieve success if we're ot repeatedly failing after all?

### These are all losing strategies
All these are things that I tried and were ineffective
but ones that I see from folks

I can understand the appeal, these strategies are
proximate to your end goal, which is getting a job. 
It feels like if you just fix your resume, or find that one referral
or check of all the boxes for SpaceX you'll make it in.

The biggest downside is these strategies largely focus
on the company you're trying to get which leaves
you reacting to what you think they want.

## Another set of strategies
Here's a list that I believe works much better

1. Do the best work you can in a way that relates to your desired role
2. Be able to articulate the details and why it brings value
3. Showcase that work in a way that builds your reputation
4. Trust your recruiter (if you have one)

Instead of focusing on a specific company or role as your
primary outcome I strongly suggest instead focusing on doing
your best work wherever you can. This builds a solid foundation
of aptitude which is what organizations are testing for. 
This should be most of your effort.

Be able to explain what your work is and why it is valuable.
For example if doing a machine learning project be able to explain
the details of your model, and why your model is best suited to
produce value with the choices you've made. Be able to explain
why other choices would be less valuable. 

There's the whole adage of "If a tree falls in the forest does it 
make a sound?". Find ways to put your work out in a way that
gets noticed. If you are in college join clubs with others
where your peers can see your outcomes. 
If you are in a company already present your work internally, as your
colleagues may move companies and be able to vouch for you. 

If you do all of this your resume and network is a byproduct 
rather than the direct focus. 
And instead of you needing to reach out to companies, 
people will start reaching out to you, and you'll be able to land an interview
which brings us to the final point.

Once you're talking to a recruiter, become their best candidate.
Recruiter's entire job is to recruit and they *want you* to join 
the organization. They'll have insights on what works and does not
and while they can't give you the answers they will give you
really strong hints of how to get to a position.
Treat them as the strategic partners they are and take their advice.

I hope this helps. I know you likely were looking for personal advice
and it may feel impersonal that I've instead sent you this link
so let me offer you this. Ping me again with a specific question and
send me the sum of numbers in an isoformat date, with that 
I'll know you have read this and will be able to better help you.

## My own story: 0% first time success rate
Know that I've been rejected by every full time you've seen
on my LinkedIn at least once. Every. Single. One.
Just because you're not in whatever company now or got rejected
doesn't mean you aren't good enough. 
Instead of focusing on their decision, focus on yourself.
and keep working to be the best you can be.
