When [Thomas Wiecki](https://twitter.com/twiecki)
asked if I'd like coauthor a blog post with him, the obvious
answer was yes! For those who don't know Thomas is a PyMC core contributor
and the VP of Data Science at Quantopian. This is a cross post 
on his blog [While my MCMC Gently Samples](https://twiecki.github.io/),
where you'll find many other great posts like 
a [great tutorial on hierarchial models](https://twiecki.github.io/blog/2017/02/08/bayesian-hierchical-non-centered/)
and inference methods such as 
[MCMC Sampling for Dummies](https://twiecki.github.io/blog/2015/11/10/mcmc-sampling/)
