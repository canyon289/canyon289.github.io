In this blog I will post every single data science question I've been asked
during an interview, along with the context, and an in depth solution.

If you are practicing for a Data Science Interview I would advise that you
try and recreate the situation as best as possible. For instance 
if the question was asked during a phone interview, ask your friend to call
you, and work the solution over the phone with him or her.

I also will be using questions I've found online on Glassdoor or other sites.
If you have suggestions suggestions or comments  open
Github issue to let me know! All code will also be posted on Github.
