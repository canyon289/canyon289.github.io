Random Variable Algebra can be challenging to understand mathematically and can sometimes
feel counterintuitive. Things that have helped me are learning the wrong ways to perform
RV Algebra as well as numerical simulation, both of which are presented in the notebook below.

A recording of me talking over slides is available [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BklWi2b6vY).
You can download the notebook [from Github](https://github.com/canyon289/canyon289.github.io/tree/master/dev/content/notebooks/Random_Variable_Algebra.ipynb)  
  
Happy Learning!
