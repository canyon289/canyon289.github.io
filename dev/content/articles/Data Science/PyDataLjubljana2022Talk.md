Successful decisioning making with data in a business isn't automatic.
And it doesn't happen by importing a library 
and writing a couple lines of code.
There are many factors to consider from data, to timing, to use case.
This was the topic of my talk from PyData Ljubljana.
In the talk I shared my learnings from the various organizations 
where I've needed aid a decision with the use of data.

You can find the slides below,
I hope they help you in the challenges you're facing.
