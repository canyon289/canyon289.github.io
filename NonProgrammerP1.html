	<h1 class="post-title">Part 1: Programming without being a Programmer</h1>
	<span class="post-date">Mon 09 January 2017</span>
	<p>This is Part 1 in a series about how learning how to program could affect
your career and some of the experiences I've had with programming in mine</p>
<ul>
<li>Intent of series and introduction</li>
<li>What Programming without being a Programmer means</li>
<li>Why Programming could be beneficial for your life and career</li>
<li>Why Programming could be detrimental for your life and career</li>
<li>My lessons and experiences writing code as a non programmer</li>
<li>Steps I'm taking in the future</li>
</ul>
<h1>An Introduction</h1>
<p>Whether you <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=you%20should%20learn%20to%20code">should</a>, 
<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=why%20you%20should%20learn%20to%20code">or should not</a>
learn to program (or code) is a pretty hotly contested topic. The opinions
usually focus on whether you quit your current career and focus on 
programming as a full time job, but there is another option of learning
programming on the side to supplement your current career. I'll be writing about
that.</p>
<p>I'm not going to try to sway you one way or another, but I will give you
my thoughts and let you form your own decision. I'm writing this
so others trying to make a reasoned decision can consider my experience
if they find it useful. Although I've been exposed to computers
my entire life, I really picked it up professionally 5 years ago sort
of unintentionally.  </p>
<p>Off the bat I'll say that learning to program on the side has been extremely
beneficial for my career. I've been able solve problems in my domain
that others couldn't, even full time "trained" programmers, and I've been able
to gain much more flexibility and satisfaction out of my job.</p>
<p>However it wasn't the simplest thing, I wasn't able to do it in "24 hours"
or within one bootcamp, or even three. Even so others I knew didn't make
any traction at all, and learning to program really did nothing to benefit
their career. Even with my positive experience, discussions with others
have led me to advise them to avoid programming.
Programming isn't a silver bullet to success, even myself
typing right now I know programming alone is not going to be able to magically
be the one thing that makes everything awesome at my job. But its undeniable
that it's a skill, both as a hobby and as a marketable ability.</p>
<h1>What to expect</h1>
<p>In the upcoming articles I'll talk about some of the benefits, but also
challenges, I faced when attemping to do this, how I was able work the
new skills into my current career and how interactions with full time
developers worked and didn't work. In the next post I'll specifically
talk about what I mean with the title</p>
