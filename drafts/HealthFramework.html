	<h1 class="page-title">A fitness progression mindset for desk workers</h1>
	<p class="post-date">Mon 07 June 2021</p>
	<p>There was more interest and questions from my why fitness post 
<a href="../WhyFitness.html">Why Fitness</a> than I had expected.
The questions I received confirmed my own experience, there
is a lot advice for fitness professions, random bits of advice, and
clickbait. But and there isn't widely  available distilled advice on how to 
achieve "intermediate level" fitness as a knowledge worker. </p>
<p>In a series of blog posts I will "open source" how I structured, tracked,
and achieved my specific results. This first post will cover a more generic
progression mindset, as opposed to outcome mindset.
The subsequent essays will focus on strength
and body recomposition(We'll talk more about this means later), as well
as my experience working through the process while holding down
a desk job.</p>
<p>Before we start I want to plainly state,
There isn't "one trick" or magic secret that fixes it all.
The advice is going to largely fall along the well established
lines of narratives of "diet, exercise and patience". </p>
<h2 id="why-some-preexisting-frameworks-lead-to-frustration">Why some preexisting frameworks lead to frustration</h2>
<p>Many folks are looking to reach a goal, such as lifting X amount of
weight, looking a certain way,  or losing Y amount of kilos 
If we break this down there are two typically are two key components, 
promised either explicitly or impliciitly in many of these. 
These an achievement level, and a timeframe. </p>
<p>In the fitness industry a natural place for people to first look
is at what professionals do because they want to "be like them"
These are cross fit athletes, professional body builders or powerlifters or actors
the ones that structure their entire life around their physical performance
or aesthetic. These are folks that reached a specific <em>very high</em> achievement
level because they needed to to be competitive. This could be lifting
a fixed amount of weight, reaching a certain look, etc.</p>
<p>This is where you'll read things like eat six meals a day,
or do a morning and night exercise session. It's often unclear however
if this is what they needed to do to start making progress or what
was needed to get the "extra edge" towards the the end. 
These tips if implemented could be helpful, 
but as someone that wants to keep their desk job 
job its not feasible to do both,
and therefore won't actually get you results.  It's worth noting
here that their results reprsent both selection and survivorship bias
as well, we usually focus heavily on the winners of the winners. The ones
that got the gold medals for instance, not even the other
very successful atheletes that qualified.</p>
<p>There's other frameworks that promise specific results within
a fixed time period. Say 90 days to get abs or 30 days to lose 30 pounds
of weight. Programs like these are tempting because they promise
specific results in a time bound but without knowing a starting point
its impossible to know if this is achievable.</p>
<h3 id="additional-noise">Additional Noise</h3>
<p>There's also "fitness entertainment" and scams are very prevalent.
Fitness entertaiment are things like Mens Health, 
There is a sea of articles that provide random tips such as 
"replace soda with water",i or "walking an hour burns calories". 
These tips aren't very structured and its unclear
what effect they'll have towards moving you towards a goal
Some of their tips probably work but the noise to signal
ratio is high. 
Their content structure
is meant to be one that isn't optimized for getting you structured informationn
but moreso be entertaining so you keep paying them, through either subscriptions
or video views. </p>
<p>What ends up happening is when people try and build plans around
this content they have "fitness ADD" and keep switching things up based
on the "hot tip" and never actually get anywhere, except frustrated with
lack of progress. </p>
<p>And lastly theres scams there's nothing surprising here, some
people will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg84UW4F6r">lie to you to get your money</a>.</p>
<h2 id="set-a-goal-track-relentlessly-focus-on-the-gradient-make-changes-as-needed">Set a goal, track relentlessly, focus on the gradient, make changes as needed</h2>
<p>What I suggest instead is setting a general goal, finding a beginner program,
and then tracking your progress, specifically your rate of improvement.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on one large specific outcome at a future date, your focus
lies on your progress week over week, or month over month. </p>
<p>There's a couple key ideas.
1. Reduces focus on the starting point and ending point
2. Shortens the feedback loop as you're assessing progess in multiple shorter time frames
3. Provides a structure for you to iterate intelligently fixed intervals
4. Changes mindset for success on progress rather than success on outcome</p>
<p>In my experience its the accumulation of these small decision
with frequent assessments that led to my results.
Each week I would assess my rate of weight loss and strength gain and 
determine if I was on track, or if progress was slower if I could accept it
or if further changes were needed.</p>
<p>What were describing here essentially an experimentation
framework. Each week or month you check if you're making progress.
If not you can decide to make a change and check again. If you made
progress great, if you didn't the process repeats.</p>
<h3 id="why-incremental-vs-absolute-progress-works-better-for-knowledge-workers">Why incremental vs absolute progress works better for knowledge workers</h3>
<p>The focus on progression rather than outcome works for knowledge
workers because we have one key advantage, we don't need to reach
a specific achievement level on a deadline. There's no competition
date, or movie shooting timeline, that we need to meet. As long
as consistent progress is being made you <em>are</em> successful.</p>
