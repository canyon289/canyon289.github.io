	<h1 class="post-title">Using Linux Part 2</h1>
	<span class="post-date">Sun 20 August 2017</span>
	<p>A couple of months ago I decided to start using Linux as my primary OS. In 
a prior article I wrote about some tips before you start. Although
I've messed around with Linux, and OSX for a number of years, Windows
has been my primary OS. No longer is that the case.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-switch"><a class="toclink" href="#why-the-switch">Why the switch</a></h2>
<p>I could say that its because I no longer need to use Windows only applications.
In the past when I was doing more Mechanical Engineering I would need Computer
Aided Design software such as Solidworks to do my job. But I could stop using
that and stay with Windows for general computing tasks. I could also say
it's because Windows isn't free which was my excuse when I was younger 
and had less money to pay for things. But it actually is because Windows
it not only not fun to use, it actively harms my computing experience.</p>
<h2 id="linux-is-lean"><a class="toclink" href="#linux-is-lean">Linux is lean</a></h2>
<p>Windows takes up more and more resources on my computers every year. There's
just so much built in, between drivers, utilities, bloatware installed from
other companies. A Linux install of less than one gigabyte accomplishes
everything I need.</p>
<h2 id="linux-isnt-obtrusive"><a class="toclink" href="#linux-isnt-obtrusive">Linux isn't obtrusive</a></h2>
<p>It seems that in Windows 8 and 10 Microsoft opened the floodgates for annoying
icons that live in your application launcher. In Windows 10 I keep getting
ads to use OneDrive. While these seem like a little thing the cost of the
distractions just add up over time. I don't want my personal device to
constantly be trying to force messages on me that I can't control.</p>
<h2 id="linux-doesnt-dial-home"><a class="toclink" href="#linux-doesnt-dial-home">Linux doesn't dial home</a></h2>
<p>Windows 10 seems to send back an absurd amount of data about your usage.
I'm sure its anonomized and I'm sure Microsoft will say it's to improve the 
user experience, but in a world where the NSA and CIA seem to be collecting
whatever information they want, it's unsettling to have anything more than
the bare miniumum sent through the internet.</p>
<h2 id="linux-is-just-fun"><a class="toclink" href="#linux-is-just-fun">Linux is just fun</a></h2>
<p>Clearly a personal opinion but I now find myself enjoying using Linux more
and more just for the sheer joy of having a computer I can mess around with.
I can use it as an extremely efficient blogging device, or dig into the 
internals and learn more about how computers work. Linux doesn't try to limit
me in anyway.</p>
<h2 id="im-sticking-with-it"><a class="toclink" href="#im-sticking-with-it">I'm sticking with it</a></h2>
<p>There are some things that are painful, such as configuring multi monitor 
support, or figuring out why my sound drivers don't work. But these annoyances
far outweigh the pains above. I'm enjoying being part of the Linux community
and am glad to stay with it as long as I can. </p>
