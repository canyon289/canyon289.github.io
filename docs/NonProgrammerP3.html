	<h1 class="page-title">Programming as a Non Programmer - Part 3</h1>
	<p class="post-date">Jan 23, 2017</p>
	<p>This is Part 3 in a series about how learning how to program could affect
your career and some of the experiences I've had with programming in mine</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ravinkumar.com/NonProgrammerP1.html">Intent of series and introduction</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ravinkumar.com/NonProgrammerPart2.html">What Programming as a Non Programmer means</a></li>
<li>Why not to be a programmer</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="why-you-shouldnt-learn-to-program">Why you shouldn't learn to program</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=you+should+learn+to+program">A quick Google Search</a>
shows hundreds of sites that proclaim you should learn how to program.
I've personally doubled my salary learning how to program and it was a strong
factor in SpaceX deciding to hire me. However this does not mean you should 
learn to program and there are many cases in which I have recommended that people
don't learn programming.  </p>
<p>Some reasons that I read, or I hear, usually follows the lines of  </p>
<ol>
<li>Programming is a hot skill</li>
<li>Programmers make more money</li>
<li>My boss will give me a raise if I learn how to program</li>
<li>Computers are everywhere in everyday life, you should learn how to program them </li>
<li>You'll get to work wherever you want, whenever you want </li>
<li>Founder XYZ of startup ABC made a billion dollars programming</li>
<li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurencebradford/2016/06/20/why-every-millennial-should-learn-some-code/2/#">"If you're an English Major ... or didn't go to college .. or were raised by Wolves"</a></li>
</ol>
<p>These pitches are echoed all over the place, even from Forbes magazine.
A lot of times it's accompanied by
a pitch to then pay money for a bootcamp class, or book, or subscription
to an ad sponsored email list. In these cases there's a clear reason why
you're told to program, so someone else can earn money.</p>
<p>This is not to say there aren't altruistic people teaching you how to program.
There are plenty of well-meaning people that also give the same advice,
but again I strongly believe this advice does not universally apply.</p>
<h1 id="debunking-the-reasons">Debunking the reasons</h1>
<h2 id="programming-is-not-a-get-rich-quick-scheme">Programming is not a get rich quick scheme</h2>
<p>If you're learning programming with the sole intent of making money easily,
or getting a "work from anywhere" lifestyle, consider the economics 
of this. If programming was easy, if anyone learn it in 6 months, if you can
work remotely, why would companies pay <strong>you</strong> a nice salary to do it? When I say
you, I mean you, versus a person in India, or Mexico, who can work for one 
tenth of the cost. Or you versus the high schooler down the street that
just graduated. Cal Newport writes an excellent blog series, one of the points
being that to be valuable, you must provide unique value to someone else.
What will make you a more valuable programmer versus anybody else?</p>
<h2 id="the-fact-that-computers-are-commonplace-is-not-a-compelling-argument-to-program">The fact that computers are commonplace is not a compelling argument to program</h2>
<p>It's true, computers are becoming and increasingly integral part of life,
but just because they're around isn't itself a compelling reason to
learn how to program. There are many objects that are common place,
such as cars and houses but rarely do you see the advice
"You live in a house, you should build your own", or "You use your car, you
should learn how to make your own transmission". </p>
<h2 id="learning-how-to-program-doesnt-teach-you-everything-about-computers-work">Learning how to program doesn't teach you everything about computers work</h2>
<p>Conversely programming itself is an abstraction of physical transistors or byte code,
but usually when people talk about "learning programming" they're talking about
an arbitrary middle layer. Of course learning to program is a step
in learning how computers work, but it's like saying that if you learn
how to change your oil you understand how your car works.</p>
<h2 id="the-skills-you-learned-before-are-not-as-valuable-as-programming">"The skills you learned before are not as valuable as Programming"</h2>
<p>I commonly read about how "English Majors" should learn programming.
This one bothers me the most because implies programming is a superior
skillset to whatever a person already knows. I feel like approach
is largely negative, and even if it were true, is not a good way to convince 
people to program. I feel that people should be interested in an activity
for its merits, rather than being scared into it by being told that 
their previous choices were largely mistakes.</p>
<h1 id="past-the-flashy-titles">Past the flashy titles</h1>
<p>If you look past click bait titles there's some underlying truths to 
how people generate value from their skills.</p>
<h2 id="writing-a-program-is-easy-mastering-programming-is-hard">Writing a program is easy, mastering programming is hard</h2>
<p>I write English. There are other people that
also write English such as JK Rowling, Tom Clancy, and J.R.R. Tolkien.
Yet those people were paid millions of dollars for their words. I doubt
anyone will pay me for the words on this  blog. The difference is those people have mastered
the English language in their own unique way through years of hard work and practice.</p>
<p>Learning to do program isn't free, even if Youtube videos or books cost $0 dollars
online you'll need to spend many hours of your life focusing on learning
programming (or any other skill really). </p>
<h2 id="programming-skills-by-themselves-are-rarely-valued">Programming skills by themselves are rarely valued</h2>
<p>Pay attention to the skillsets of the people that earned value from
programming, usually people like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg are examples.
Those people were good at programming, but they were also good at other things,
especially leadership and figuring out what people wanted. A good programmer
that can't communicate or work with others usually does not have a great life.
An unfortunate example of this is Phil Katz, who was an extraordinary programmer,
but had trouble working with others and arguably did not have an ideal life in
his later days. Strongly consider what skills you have that you can work on 
outside of programming constantly.</p>
<h1 id="the-summary">The Summary</h1>
<p>There's a lot of good reasons to learn how to program, but the reasons
above in my opinion are not the right ones. If you're deciding to program
I would carefully evaluate if you're being swayed by arguments
such as the one above. If so think hard about whether learning programming
is right for you. In the next post I'll talk about reasons why learning
programming can be beneficial.</p>
