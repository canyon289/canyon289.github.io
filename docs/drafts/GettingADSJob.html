	<h1 class="page-title">Getting that job at that one company that you think is cool</h1>
	<p class="post-date">Mar 26, 2022</p>
	<h1 id="my-opinion-on-how-to-become-a-ds">My opinion on how to become a DS</h1>
<p>If you're reading this, chances are you have reached out to me on {LinkedIn/Twitter/Github/Email} asking how become a data scientist. 
You also may be asking after I sent you my post on how <a href="{filename}../Data Science/GettingAJob.md">to get a job</a>.
and are still left wondering about DS jobs specifically.</p>
<p>To just give you the answer here is </p>
<ol>
<li>Understand that Data Science is made up term that has little consistent meaning</li>
<li>Figure out what is the specific "thing" you like</li>
<li>Become excellent at it whatever way works best for you</li>
<li>Do it in a way that sets you up to get a job</li>
</ol>
<p>This may be an unsatisfying summary though so let's elaborate</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-data-scientist-and-what-do-they-do">What is a Data Scientist and what do they do</h2>
<p>This is the seemingly obvious question to start with,
however it also the worst one. 
Hidden in the explanation of why its so bad though there is a useful insight.</p>
<p>The honest truth is that the term Data Science is completely made up.
Now you could say "Well Ravin everything is made up" but let's dig in further.
Let's compare to my previous profession, mechanical engineering.
Mechanical engineering is a formalized with long-running organizations which set standards for the field internationally,
such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Mechanical_Engineers">American Society of Mechanical Engineers</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABET">ABET</a>.
While the idea of mechanical engineering is made up by people,
there is a key group of influential people that are defining the "center of mass"</p>
<p>There is no key group of people for data science for data science. 
Everyone is making it up, in whatever way suits their narrative.</p>
<p>On abstract end Drew Conway was one of the with this first popular venn diagram.</p>
<p><img alt="Drew Conway Image" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5150aec6e4b0e340ec52710a/1364352051365-HZAS3CLBF7ABLE3F5OBY/Data_Science_VD.png"></p>
<p>While it's appealing in simplicity, it's unhelpful for newcomers,
as it's not clear where to start or what these any of these actually mean.</p>
<p>Typical of data scientist writings someone then takes a simple framework and makes it even more complex,
unfortunately making it even less useful.</p>
<p><img alt="Complex DS Venn Diagram" src="http://georgejmount.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1d115e30-ae3b-42a5-b86f-00b97797b787-original.jpeg"></p>
<p>On the other end some people try to strictly define data science to exactly what they do.
They then post their opinions on Twitter and LinkedIn and arguments ensue,
which also do not help newcomers.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In my particular data science role, I don&#39;t currently use statistics. Or R. Or deep learning. But I also don&#39;t go around telling people those aren&#39;t useful in data science as though my job represents all data science work</p>&mdash; Ben Lindsay (@ben_j_lindsay) <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_j_lindsay/status/1508067296115191809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>
<p>"But these are individuals" you may say, "Companies most clearly be consistent" you also say.
Wrong again.
Companies like Lyft write publicly about <a href="https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c">relabeling all data analysts to scientists, and all data scientists to research scientists</a> with no change in expected responsibilities. 
Doordash has data scientist roles but when you interview you learn are not alike at all,
not interchangeable internally and have to completely separate organizational structures.</p>
<p>So how else can we frame the problem?</p>
<h3 id="a-subset-of-a-set-skills">A subset of a set skills</h3>
<p>Because I have been knighted with the title Data Scientist
I'm legally obligated to provide my own take on this mess,
or at least make it worse. 
Let's do that.</p>
<p>I tend to think of data science as a <strong>subset</strong> of a set of skills.
This could include algorithm development, dashboarding, modeling fitting,
programming in python,
programming in SQL, fitting black box models, 
data communication, deploying Spark cluster jobs, the emotional
numbness to being asked to join two datasets with no common key,
knowing how to not laugh or express shock when you stakeholders
ask for models with 99% accuracy,
writing blog posts or tweets threads about with advice on to become a data scientist
(Only half joking on this one)</p>
<p>Now some people with data scientist LinkedIn titles spend their time squeezing out .001 more precision/recall/accuracy out of a black box model.
Sometimes this role is titled Machine Learning Engineer. 
Some people find this work to be fascinating.
I think is very boring and when I was looking for jobs I would avoid these entirely.</p>
<p>I instead like working with stakeholders to understand a complex business,
and use data to inform big scale decisions.
Sometimes this role is called Decision Scientist, 
This is what I do at Google where, surprise, my title is Data Scientist,
it previously used to be called quantitative analyst.
What matters to me though is get to do what I enjoy,
which is learning things from data, and share those learnings
with others.</p>
<h2 id="a-suggested-strategy">A suggested strategy</h2>
<p>So let's focus back on you.
It's no secret the
<a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2019/02/13/data-science-is-different-now/">junior data science field is completely saturated</a>
Given that here's my suggestions for concrete steps on how to get a DS job,
This should help match you to the right company and 
put you ahead of many other candidates.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-figure-out-what-you-like">Step 1: Figure out what you like</h3>
<p>Instead of trying to nail down a specific definition of DS
start understanding about "DS" is interesting to you
and start excelling at those. 
It's a more focused strategy than trying to be good at everything
which will be impossible. 
If you take the everything strategy you won't be able to 
stand out in any interview as each company tends to look for a 
<em>specific</em> thing, even if they are different.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-get-good-at-it">Step 2: Get good at it</h3>
<p>Now that you've narrowed down DS figure out how to be great at it.</p>
<p>If you're into black box predictions places like Kaggle are the obvious answer.
If you really like algorithm development papers and algorithm
competitions would be a good area to focus on.</p>
<p>For me that learning came in the form of Open Source contributions. 
By writing code and working with others I was able to more deeply learn the methods.
It also helped because the networking and public display
of value was built right in,
which I write about in my How to get a job post.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-identify-the-adjacent-skills">Step 3: Identify the adjacent skills</h3>
<p>Find a person that already are excellent and listen to their talks.
Write down all those skills. 
For instance if they work on big prediction models are they also good at 
deploying them, or are they more focused on the internal mathematics?
Do this again for another person,
then see what other skills are commonly listed or mentioned and become proficient in those as well.</p>
<p>For me I tended to see a stronger emphasis on communication. intuition,
an explanation versus model accuracy metrics.
I also saw these folks contributing examples publicly in blog posts,
talks, and open source notebooks.
I now spend much of my time honing those skills, 
writing this blog post for example.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-figure-out-what-organizations-value-your-skill">Step 4: Figure out what organizations value your skill</h3>
<p>By this point you'll have a good sense for the code words that appeal to you.
Look for job postings that specifically contain the thing you're interested in.
When interviewing be sure to ask how DS provides value to that team.
Even if you get rejected you'll have extra clues as to what to
focus on for the next interview.
Demetri Pananos provides <a href="https://dpananos.github.io/posts/2022/01/blog-post-36/">additional advice</a> on his blog.</p>
<h2 id="best-of-luck">Best of luck</h2>
<p>Unfortunately they data scientist job search is more of a random search than it should be. 
Nonetheless, if you're dead set on getting a Data Scientist job I hope this advice helps, 
And once you get a DS job be sure to send me a link to your blog post or
tweet thread sharing your advice. 
At that time you too will become a true data scientist.</p>
