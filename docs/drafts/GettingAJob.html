	<h1 class="page-title">Getting that job at that one company that you think is cool</h1>
	<p class="post-date">Mar 26, 2022</p>
	<p>If you are reading this you likely have reached to me on <code>{LinkedIn/Twitter/Github/Email}</code>
asking how to get a job at <code>{Google/SpaceX/Sweetgreen/Some other company}</code>.
If so this post is for you. 
Rather a short 280 character response,
or off the cuff reply you'll be better served by a longer answer.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-not-believe-me-at-least-exclusively">Why you should not believe me (at least exclusively)</h2>
<p>Before reading the rest oof the post you should know the following.</p>
<h3 id="im-only-one-person">I'm only one person</h3>
<p>Any individual is going to be biased, both in their lived experience and the way they tell it.</p>
<div style="justify-content: center;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">People have been repeating that nonsense forever <br><br>Remember that successful people can often be highly biased to think that other successful people have to be just like them, itâ€™s simply not true at all</p>&mdash; Hamel Husain (@HamelHusain) <a href="https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1507757669867667456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
 </div>

<p>Aside from this post look for other people's experiences 
to get a distribution of perspectives and form your own independent conclusion.
Which brings me to my second point</p>
<h3 id="survivorship-bias">Survivorship Bias</h3>
<p><img src="../images/GettingAJob/SurvivorshipBias.png"/></p>
<p>Only looking for successful cases has a name, it is called survivorship bias.</p>
<p>When forming a strategy be sure to consider two more categories of folks.</p>
<ol>
<li>People that have applied and didn't get a job  </li>
<li>People that have worked there and quit  </li>
</ol>
<p>The second group provides the most valuable feedback. For example,
I can tell you why I joined <em>and</em> left SpaceX , but I can't
tell you why I left Google because I haven't left yet. 
Be sure to balance your information sourcing accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-wrote-this">Why I wrote this</h2>
<p>After all that it might seem pointless for me to say anything. Yet again there 
are two reasons I'll did so.</p>
<h3 id="i-was-once-like-you">I was once like you</h3>
<p>At the start of my career I also wanted to get into particular organizations.
I didn't really know how so I tried things like cold emailing people.
When people responded even with a short response it gave me a lot of hope.</p>
<h3 id="to-counteract-the-bad-advice-out-there">To counteract the bad advice out there</h3>
<p>The other thing I did was google "How to get a job at ..."
Now that I've worked at these companies, and more importantly
conducted interviews within them, 
I know much of the advice out there is factually false. </p>
<p>Now that people like you are reaching out to me
I feel I should provide some useful direction
even if potentially biased. In other words</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wrong data &lt; missing data &lt; biased data</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="to-save-time">To save time</h3>
<p>I can't give every person that pings me 1:1 session,
it would overwhelm me. 
Additionally it would just be inefficient as the majority of my advice would be the same.
The most sensible thing is to write it down,
so you get your questions answered in a way that scales.
Hope this helps! With that lets dive into it</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-get-a-job-at-xyz-company">"How can I get a job at XYZ company?"</h2>
<p>Here are some possible strategies!</p>
<h3 id="ask-for-blind-referrals-or-advice">Ask for blind referrals or advice</h3>
<p>Connect with everyone at Google on Linkedin and DM them your resume.</p>
<h3 id="resume-engineering">Resume Engineering</h3>
<p>Stack the resume with lots of programming languages and the latest buzzwords.
The more the better.</p>
<h3 id="getting-your-information-from-clickbait-sources">Getting your information from clickbait sources</h3>
<p>Google common interview questions for company XYZ and memorize them. 
Here's one for SpaceX.</p>
<p>You start at a point, walk one mile south, one mile east, one mile north, and end up at the same
point. Where are you?  Know the answer yet? Quick this is <a href="https://www.topinterview.com/interview-advice/how-to-answer-Elon-Musks-favorite-interview-question">Elon Musk's favorite question!</a></p>
<h3 id="narrow-focus">Narrow focus</h3>
<p>It's that "one company" or that "one perfect role" that is perfect for you.
Maybe its even a couple, one of the FAANG companies.
If you focus on one company or one role as your next step you'll surely make it in.</p>
<h3 id="keep-trying-the-same-thing-over">Keep trying the same thing over</h3>
<p>At this point I'm sure you've heard about Michael Jordan taking 10,000 shots
or Steve Jobs getting fired. 
If you fail just try doing the exact same thing again.
After all how can we achieve success if we're not repeatedly failing after all?</p>
<h3 id="these-are-all-losing-strategies">These are all losing strategies</h3>
<p>These are things that I tried earlier in my career and turned out to be ineffective for me.</p>
<p>I can understand the appeal, these strategies are
directly proximate to your end goal, which is getting a job. 
It feels like if you just fix your resume, or find that one referral
or check of all the boxes for SpaceX you'll make it in. 
The biggest downside is these strategies largely focus
on the company you're trying to get which leaves
you reacting to what you think they want rather
than building up yourself.</p>
<h2 id="another-set-of-strategies">Another set of strategies</h2>
<p>Here's some steps that I believe are more effective.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do the best work you can in a way that relates to your desired role</li>
<li>Be able to articulate the details and why it brings value</li>
<li>Showcase that work in a way that builds your reputation</li>
<li>Trust your recruiter (if you have one)</li>
<li>If you lose the role, adjust and try again</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of focusing on a specific company or role as your
primary outcome I strongly suggest focusing on doing
your best work wherever you can. This builds a solid foundation
of aptitude which is what organizations are looking for. 
This should be most of your effort.</p>
<p>Be able to explain what your work is and why it is valuable.
For example if working on a machine learning project be able to explain
the details of your model, and why your model is best suited to
produce value with the choices you've made. Be able to explain
why other choices would be less valuable. </p>
<p>There's the whole adage of "If a tree falls in the forest does it 
make a sound?" Find ways to showcase your work in a way that
gets noticed. If you are in college join clubs with others
where your peers can see your outcomes. 
If you are in a company present your work internally, as your
colleagues may move companies and be able to vouch for you. </p>
<p>If you do all of this your resume and network is a byproduct 
rather than the direct focus. 
And instead of you needing to reach out to companies, 
people will start reaching out to you, and you'll be able to land an interview
which brings us to the final point.</p>
<p>Once you're talking to a recruiter, become their best candidate.
Recruiter's entire job is to recruit and they <em>want you</em> to join the organization.
They'll have insights on what works and does not 
and while they can't give you the answers they will give you
really strong hints of how to get to a position.
Treat them as the strategic partners they are and take their advice.</p>
<p>If you get the job great! If you don't ask the recruiter,
if you've built a good relationship with them they'll likely
give you feedback. Again though don't focus solely on that
one company, or one interview. Go back to the earlier
steps and keep building expertise and communication skills
until yuo get another shot.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. I know you likely were looking for personal advice
and it may feel impersonal that I've instead sent you this link
so let me offer you this. Ping me again with a specific question and
send me the sum of numbers in an isoformat date, with that 
I'll know you have read this and will be able to better help you.</p>
<h2 id="my-own-story-0-first-time-success-rate">My own story: 0% first time success rate</h2>
<p>Know that I've been rejected by every full time you've seen
on my LinkedIn at least once. Every. Single. One.
Just because you're not in whatever company now or got rejected
doesn't mean you aren't good enough. 
Instead of focusing on their decision, focus on yourself.
and keep working to be the best you can be.</p>
