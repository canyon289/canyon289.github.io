	<h1 class="page-title">My Guide on Data Science Programs</h1>
	<p class="post-date">Dec 01, 2016</p>
	<p>I recently got accepted to the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree program.
While I am planning to write about that when it starts, now is a good
time to talk about the experience I've had with previous Data Science programs.  </p>
<h2 id="why-am-i-doing-this">Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>As a beginner it's hard to figure out what's worthwhile and what's
snake oil, and these days there seems to be hundreds of books, MOOCs, bootcamps
and traditional degrees that are vying for your money and time. For those
doing research I hope my experience gives you more information to make
an informed decision.</p>
<h2 id="what-basis-does-my-opinion-have">What basis does my opinion have?</h2>
<p>In the past five years I've enrolled in the Thinkful Data Science course,
the Coursera Data Science specialization, the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree,
and was accepted to the Berkeley Masters in Data Science masters degree
program. Between these programs I've spent thousands of dollars and hours
trying to improve my skills with these programs. Not all of this time 
was well spent and I bet I could have spent about a third less to get
where I am now.</p>
<h2 id="so-where-are-you-now">So where <em>are</em> you now?</h2>
<p>The details are in the <a href="pages/About.html">About Me</a> but essentially I do
data science work for a living. The programs above actually did help me
transition into the career I wanted, but as mentioned I could have made better
decisions.</p>
<h1 id="the-guide">The Guide</h1>
<p>The six categories I've been exposed to are  </p>
<ul>
<li>Self Learning from Internet</li>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Coursera Data Science Courses and Specialization</li>
<li>Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree</li>
<li>Berkeley Masters in Data Science</li>
<li>A PhD</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's my thoughts on each one</p>
<h2 id="self-learn-from-internet">Self Learn from Internet</h2>
<p>This is certainly the easiest, cheapest, and most flexible. The hard
part though is piecing together an education that is cohesive and increases
in difficulty at an appropriate rate. You'll have to spend a lot of time
both figuring out what you want to learn, finding good resources on that topic
and actually learning it. Figuring out what you want to learn might seem
easy until you realize how many buzzwords now exist in the data science space.
Do you want to learn about Machine Learning or recommender systems? What about
Deep Learning, or how about Convolutional Neural Networks. What about
Theano, TensorFlow, or Caffe? When googling by yourself it takes a lot
of effort to figure out what topics are relevant and which ones are buzzwords.</p>
<p>Sources in this category that I recommend are <a href="www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> and 
articles that appear on <a href="www.hackernews.com">HackerNews</a> and <a href="www.datatau.com">DataTau</a>
but there are literally thousands. You can also take the free courses 
from Coursera and Udacity. I'll be talking more about their paid programs
below.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>Similar to Internet learning you'll have to first find books that are
appropriate to the topic you want to learn. When you do find an appropriate
book however the good news is that it likely covers the topic into much
more detail than a series of blog posts does. However, the downside is that
it's hard to get feedback from a book and if you're left with questions
you have to revert to the Self Learn from the Internet method.</p>
<p>An example of a book that I found to be informative includes
<a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/">Elements of Statistical Learning</a>.
Again like the Internet category there are hundreds, if not thousands, of 
Data Science related books in every category and I could not possibly list
them all.  </p>
<p>If you've read this far you must really be interested in learning Data Science.
If so that's good because everything from here down requires more commitment
and money.</p>
<h2 id="coursera-data-science-courses">Coursera Data Science Courses</h2>
<p>Coursera has two ways you can learn. One is taking free courses, but the 
more notable is paying for their specializations. For the money Coursera's
Specializations give you two things that Books and Self Learning do not.
One is that they guide you through a series of Data Science topics over the
span of a couple of months, reducing the need for you to piece together
your own curriculum. The other and much more important, is they give you
a community and feedback on your assignments. The specializations require
you to pass quizzes and finish small two week projects that are peer reviewed. 
This is great because
getting feedback from others is in my opinion the best way to learn.</p>
<p>However, the downside is that the reviewers are usually your peers, and they
unfortunately they don't know much more than you typically. Another downside
is their motive for feedback is usually just so they can pass the course themselves,
giving feedback is a requirement for passing. Therefore, I personally found
the feedback to be pretty weak. I made it through 8 out of 10 of the
courses in the Specialization before I stopped participating. The cost
of the Coursera Data Science program was a fixed 500 dollars.</p>
<h2 id="udacity-data-analyst-nanodegree">Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree</h2>
<p>Udacity, like Coursera, has both free and guided courses. However, the major
difference I found was that Udacity gives you much more access to more experienced
mentors. The Udacity projects are much more substantive, some taking more 
than a month to complete, and during the process you get continuous feedback
from those more experienced mentors. The feedback was critical and 
forced me to really learn and execute concepts correctly. It was much different
than Coursera, from which i felt other peers would just rubber stamp my 
work so they could pass. The cost of the program was $200 dollars a month
for each month enrolled in the program with the program ending when you finished
all seven projects with passing reviews. If you finished within 12 months
Udacity refunded half the money, a clever way to keep you motivated.</p>
<p>A potential downside of the Udacity program was that was self-paced, which 
is great if you have motivation, but bad when you didn't. </p>
<h2 id="berkeley-master-in-data-science-program">Berkeley Master in Data Science Program</h2>
<p>The Master Degree programs are some of the newest kids on the block in terms
of Data Science accreditations. The allure is that they combine traditional
education with newer data science topics. I enrolled in the 
Berkeley program because I felt that I would get a comprehensive education 
with access to experts in the field, along with the Berkeley accreditation.
After all a number of the leading experts who pioneered the data methods that
are commonplace now graduated from Berkeley, Stanford, and other high
pedigree schools.</p>
<p>However the programs are expensive, <strong>REALLY</strong> expensive. The cost
for Berkeley's program came out to $60,000 dollars, not including additional
costs like applications fees, travel fees to the campus if you have to visit,
books etc. And the barrier to entry is high, you'll need to have a bachelors already
and complete a Masters degree application.</p>
<p>Although I was accepted and attended roughly a month's worth of the lectures
I ultimately ended up dropping out because I felt the price to value ratio
was lot, especially since I already had spent tens of thousands of dollars on
two other bachelors and masters degrees. The program itself was well-thought-out
and well put together, but given the much cheaper alternatives above I couldn't
justify staying in the program after I learned more about it.</p>
<h2 id="phd">PhD</h2>
<p>The last and hardest path is to
get a PhD in a field related to data science. After all nearly all the people
that have forged the way in Data methods have done so through research
and doctorate level work. I myself was enrolled in a PhD program but for
those considering this option you already know it's a very heavy investment
requiring at least half a decades worth of work. You're going to have
to read a lot more than this blog post, and do a lot of soul search, before
deciding if this option is really what you want to do.</p>
<h1 id="the-other-options">The Other Options</h1>
<h2 id="bootcamps">Bootcamps</h2>
<p>There are Data Science Bootcamps run by companies like Metis. These
typically involve studying on site in places like New York through an intensive
12 week program. The cost seems to be in the multi thousands. For the money
though you get to build a network and get coaching in person.</p>
<p>I never applied for this option because of the opportunity cost, I would
have had to quit a paying job, or quit a degreed program I was already in,
to participate in these. But if you have the time and money these may be a good
option for you.</p>
<h2 id="hands-on-experience">Hands-on experience</h2>
<p>If you can find someone that will mentor you at your job that is by far
the best option. Nothing beats real world experience in learning how to actually
do the job. You may need to refer to some of the learning above to get the
fundamentals but experience is a great teacher.</p>
<h1 id="so-what-should-i-do">So what should I do?</h1>
<p>If you're just starting out I suggest you start with an Udacity Nanodegree.
I think it has the best balance of low cost, but with expert mentorship
and just difficult enough projects to grow. After that you'll also have
enough experience to hone in on useful internet and book references without
getting fooled by marketing pitches.  And since a Nanodegree only typically
takes a year to complete, the time investment is pretty low.</p>
<p>I personally don't think the MIDS program is worth the cost. A traditional
statistics or mathematics masters costs a third of the price at most
universities and I believe it's much more valuable.</p>
<p>As for the PhD if you're reading this blog post as your first reference
I'll say having a PhD is a pretty significant achievement, but it's not a light
decision and you should really read more and think on if this is ultimately
the right choice for you.</p>
<p>As always if you have any further questions feel free to send me a message
on LinkedIn or Github. </p>
