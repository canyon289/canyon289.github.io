	<span class="post-date">Wed 20 April 2016</span>
	<p>tldr at the bottom</p>
<p>I have an admission to make. I so far have been
unable to successfully pass a Data Science interview.
For those who 
<a href="http://treycausey.com/data_science_interviews.html">have been through the process</a> 
<a href="http://www.erinshellman.com/crushed-it-landing-a-data-science-job/">you might understand why</a> 
but my own thoughts are below</p>
<h2 id="whys-an-interview-so-difficult"><a class="toclink" href="#whys-an-interview-so-difficult">Why's an interview so difficult</a></h2>
<p>In a non interview setting when I'm asked a question, I'm able to do some 
background research, find other known solutions, and weave together a solution.
This process can take an hour up to a couple of days depending on the need.</p>
<p>However during an interview I get short period of time to understand the
problem, think through a solution, and articulate an answer, usually while
someone is physically watching you or waiting on the phone. It's pretty nerve
wracking.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-ds-interview-is-so-difficult"><a class="toclink" href="#why-the-ds-interview-is-so-difficult">Why the DS interview is so difficult</a></h2>
<p>During my Manufacturing Engineering interviews when I'm asked a question
it's almost always about Manufacturing Engineering. I feel confident in my 
understanding and I'm able to convincly answer questions. I know this 
because I've gotten Manufacturing Engineering jobs.</p>
<p>However during Data Scientist interviews, when I'm asked a question it ranges
from basic probability, to advanced statistics, to software engineering,
to database concepts, to business communication. The range of possibilities
is enormous.</p>
<p>As turns out that I am not able to convincingly answer all of these questions
as I've now had multiple first round
interviews but failed to make it to the final round or secure a job.
Seems that other people have this problem too</p>
<h2 id="my-second-admissions-and-why-this-blog"><a class="toclink" href="#my-second-admissions-and-why-this-blog">My second admissions and why this blog</a></h2>
<p>I am partly making this blog to help myself
Every question I get asked during a data science interview will go onto
this blog, where it will be discussed, solved, and then dissected into great
detail. By explaining the answer on a public blog I also hope to gain the
ability to clearly explain advanced concepts, all in preparation for the next time.</p>
<p>However there is an altruistic side to this blog as well. I would have
never made it this far without the knowledge others have shared. Through
this blog I hope to add yet another place that others can use to learn more
about data science in general.</p>
<h2 id="tldr"><a class="toclink" href="#tldr">tldr</a></h2>
<p>I consistently fail at data science interviews, so I'm starting this blog
with the dual purpose of forcing me practice DS interview questions,
but also to hopefully serve as a helpful resource for others.</p>
